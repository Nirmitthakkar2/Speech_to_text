## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This guide will teach you how to add your API key to the Speech to Text application in simple, easy-to-follow steps. **No coding knowledge required!**

## 📖 What is an API Key?

Think of an API key like a special password that allows your app to use AI features. 

**Simple analogy:** Just like you need a WiFi password to connect to the internet, you need an API key to use the AI text refinement feature.

## ✨ Why Do You Need It?

**Without API Key:**
- ✅ You can record audio
- ✅ You can see basic transcription
- ❌ But you won't get AI-improved, polished text

**With API Key:**
- ✅ Record audio
- ✅ See basic transcription
- ✅ Get AI-improved text with proper grammar, punctuation, and formatting

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Your API Key is Safe Because:

1. **Stored locally:** Your API key is saved only in your browser on your computer
2. **Not sent to our servers:** We never receive or store your API key
3. **Only you can access it:** Only you can see and modify your API key
4. **Easy to remove:** You can delete it anytime using the "Remove Key" button

**In simple terms:** It's like saving a password in your browser - it stays on your device only.
